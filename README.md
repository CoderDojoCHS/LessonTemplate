# Lesson Plan Template

A template for GitHub CoderDojo programming tutorial. This document can be treated as a quick reference for 
preparing CoderDojo sessions.

For a sample lesson that follows this schema, see LESSON.md


### What we will be building
------------------------------------------

**Brief Overview**

- Start by explaining what will be built
- Give a brief overview of the technology or programming language that is going to be used
- Showcase the final product before starting
  - If the demo is web based, point them to the demo URL (JSFiddle, Codepen, etc)
  - If the demo is script based, point them to the source code
  - This will allow advanced learners to play with the code while others catch up

### Prerequisites
------------------------------------------

**Tools**

- Make sure they have a common web browser and code editor present
- List the tools that will be used during the lesson
  - If additional software is required:
     - Ensure that the software is available on Mac and Windows
     - Stick with freely available software
     - When possible, link to the direct download URL
     - For long links, use a URL shortener
  - If a webservice is required:
     - Ensure that no registration is required to use the service
     - Check the service's browser compatibility

**Experience**

- Check if the lesson requires prior knowledge
  - For a certain technology (JS plugin or programming language):
     - Confirm if it has been used before
     - Check if students can recall previously taught syntax and concepts
  - If using mathematial concepts:
     - Check if the students are familiar with the concept
     - Use analogies to explain the concepts, if complex

### Implementation
------------------------------------------

**Code**

- Arrange code blocks as functions and useful chunks
- Use indicative variable names ( *height* instead of h)
- Use GitHub's extended markdown for syntax highlighting
- Add frequent screenshots of the stages of development

**Explanation**

- After every code block, explain what the aforementioned code does
  - This can be conveyed in point form
  - This section should be used for pointing out how different pieces (services, functions, etc) talk to each other
  - Explanation can range from sharing a new concept to simply interpreting the code in english


### Customization
------------------------------------------

After the implementation lesson is finished, you can transition into pointing out any additional customizations
that can be performed to what was built. This could include changing values in the code to see different outcomes,
changing colors of items or even adding additional functionality.

- This sectional can be treated as self driven by students or mentor directed
- Display a list of possible customizations that can be performed (changing colors, enabling/disabling features, etc)
- This can also be promoted by displaying customized demos or screenshots where students can try to replicate what is shown


### Additional Resources
------------------------------------------

You can also point out links to any additional resources (cool demos, extensions, documentation, etc) that may be
related to the technology/programming language used for the class. This is optional.


### Homework
------------------------------------------

Additionaly, you can also assign homework (also optional) where students can combine work from the customization
section and any other critera you may wish to provide. For example, an exercise can include converting a JSFiddle page to
a HTML, CSS, JS page
