# Lesson Plan Template

A template for GitHub CoderDojo programming tutorial

## Lession Name

### What we will be building
------------------------------------------

**Brief Overview**

- As the very first step, you would generally start with showing everyone what we will be building by the end of the session
- This would then be followed by talking about the technology or programming language that is going to be utilized
- You would then transition to the final product demo, followed by the steps to getting started

**Demo**

- Point the students to the demo page before starting
  - If the demo is web based, point them to the web URL (JSFiddle, Codepen, etc)
  - If the demo is script based, point them to the source code
- This will allow advanced learners to play with the code while others catch up

### Prerequisites
------------------------------------------

**Tools**

- Make sure they have a common web browser and code editor present
- You would then list the tools that will be used during the lesson
  - If an additional software is required, point them to the download link
     - Ensure that the software is available on Mac and Windows
     - Stick with freely available software
     - If possible, link to the direct download URL
     - For a long link, try using a URL shortener
  - If a webservice is required for the lession, point them to the webpage
     - Ensure that no registration is required to use the service
     - Check the service's browser compatibility

**Experience**

- After development setup, be sure to check if the lesson requires having prior knowledge
  - Check for experience with a certain technology
     - If using a javascript plugin, for example:
         - Check if it has been used before.
         - Check if students can recall previously taught syntax and concepts
     - If using a programming language, for example:
         - Check if it has been taught before
         - Check if students can recall the syntax
  - If using mathematial concepts in the lession:
     - Check if the students are familiar with the concept
     - Use analogies to explain the concept

### Implementation
------------------------------------------

**Code**

- Arrange code blocks as functions and useful chunks
- Try to implement indicative variable names ( *topic* instead of i)
- Use GitHub's extended markdown for syntax highlighting
- When possible, add screenshots of the stages of development to the documentation

**Explanation**

- After every code block, try to explain what the aforementioned code does
  - This can mostly be conveyed in point form
  - This section can be used for pointing out how different pieces (services, functions, etc) talk to each other
  - Explanation can range from sharing a new concept to simply interpreting the code in english
