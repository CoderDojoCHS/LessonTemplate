# Lesson Plan Template

A template for GitHub CoderDojo programming tutorial. This document can be treated as a quick reference for 
preparing CoderDojo sessions and is in no way an absolute guideline for preparing a lesson.


## Lession Name

### What we will be building
------------------------------------------

**Brief Overview**

- As the very first step, you would generally start with showing everyone what we will be building by the end of the session
- This would then be followed by talking about the technology or programming language that is going to be utilized
- You would then transition to the final product demo, followed by the steps to getting started

**Demo**

- Point the students to the demo page before starting
  - If the demo is web based, point them to the web URL (JSFiddle, Codepen, etc)
  - If the demo is script based, point them to the source code
- This will allow advanced learners to play with the code while others catch up

### Prerequisites
------------------------------------------

**Tools**

- Make sure they have a common web browser and code editor present
- You would then list the tools that will be used during the lesson
  - If an additional software is required, point them to the download link
     - Ensure that the software is available on Mac and Windows
     - Stick with freely available software
     - If possible, link to the direct download URL
     - For a long link, try using a URL shortener
  - If a webservice is required for the lession, point them to the webpage
     - Ensure that no registration is required to use the service
     - Check the service's browser compatibility

**Experience**

- After development setup, be sure to check if the lesson requires having prior knowledge
  - Check for experience with a certain technology
     - If using a javascript plugin, for example:
         - Check if it has been used before.
         - Check if students can recall previously taught syntax and concepts
     - If using a programming language, for example:
         - Check if it has been taught before
         - Check if students can recall the syntax
  - If using mathematial concepts in the lession:
     - Check if the students are familiar with the concept
     - Use analogies to explain the concept

### Implementation
------------------------------------------

**Code**

- Arrange code blocks as functions and useful chunks
- Try to implement indicative variable names ( *topic* instead of i)
- Use GitHub's extended markdown for syntax highlighting
- When possible, add screenshots of the stages of development to the documentation

**Explanation**

- After every code block, try to explain what the aforementioned code does
  - This can mostly be conveyed in point form
  - This section can be used for pointing out how different pieces (services, functions, etc) talk to each other
  - Explanation can range from sharing a new concept to simply interpreting the code in english


### Customization
------------------------------------------

After the implementation lesson is finished, you can transition into pointing out any additional customizations
that can be performed to what was just built. This could include changing values in the code to see different outcomes,
changing colors of items or even adding additional functionality.

- This sectional can be treated as self driven by students or mentor directed
- You can display a list of possible customizations that can be performed (changing colors, enabling/disabling features, etc)
- This part can also be promoted by displaying demos or screenshots where students can try to replicate what was shown


### Additional Resources
------------------------------------------

You can also point out links to any additional resources (cool demos, extensions, documentation, etc) that may be
related to the technology/programming language used for the class. This is optional.


### Homework
------------------------------------------

Additionaly, you can also assign homework (not required) where students can combine work from the customization
section and any other critera you may wish to provide. For example, an exercise can include converting a JSFiddle page to
a HTML, CSS, JS page
